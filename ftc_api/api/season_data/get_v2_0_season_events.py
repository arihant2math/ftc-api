    """Event Listings

     The event listings API returns all FTC official regional events in a particular season. You can
    specify an `eventCode` if you would only like data about one specific event. If you specify an
    `eventCode` you cannot specify any other optional parameters. Alternately, you can specify a
    `teamNumber` to retrieve only the listings of events being attended by the particular team. If you
    specify a `teamNumber` you cannot specify an `eventCode`.

    The response for event listings contains a special field called divisionCode. For example, the FIRST
    Championship contains two Divisions. As an example of a response, the event listings for a Division
    will have a divisionCode that matches the FIRST Championship event code (as they are divisions of
    that event). This allows you to see the full structure of events, and how they relate to each other.

    Args:
        season (int):
        event_code (Union[Unset, None, str]):  Default: '0'.
        team_number (Union[Unset, None, int]):

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
        httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
